description: |-
  Terraform module to manage AWS Device Farm projects, device pools, network profiles, and instance profiles.
  It supports both Mobile Device Farm and Desktop Test Grid (Selenium) projects.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  This module provides a comprehensive way to manage AWS Device Farm resources using Terraform.
  It allows for the creation of mobile projects with custom device pools and network profiles,
  as well as desktop test grid projects integrated with VPC configurations.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  To use this module with Terragrunt, include it in your `terragrunt.hcl` file:

  ```hcl
  terraform {
    source = "git::https://github.com/cloudopsworks/terraform-module-aws-device-farm-management.git?ref=v1.0.0"
  }

  inputs = {
    org = {
      organization_name = "myorg"
      organization_unit = "myou"
      environment_type  = "prod"
      environment_name  = "production"
    }

    settings = {
      name                = "my-mobile-project"
      job_timeout_minutes = 150
      device_pools = {
        android_pool = {
          name = "android-pool"
          rules = [
            {
              attribute = "PLATFORM"
              operator  = "EQUALS"
              value     = "ANDROID"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Desktop Test Grid with VPC
  
  ```hcl
  inputs = {
    org = {
      organization_name = "myorg"
      organization_unit = "qa"
      environment_type  = "test"
      environment_name  = "qa-testing"
